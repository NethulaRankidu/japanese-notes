## 🌸 日本語 (Japanese Language)

Japanese (<ruby>日<rt>に</rt>本<rt>ほん</rt>語<rt>ご</rt></ruby>, _Nihongo_) is the native language of Japan, spoken by over 125 million people worldwide. A language isolate with no confirmed relatives, it's renowned for its rich history, complex writing system (kanji, hiragana, katakana, and sometimes romaji), and distinctive grammar—like the SOV (subject–object–verb) structure and varying levels of politeness. Unlike tonal Asian languages, Japanese relies on pitch accent, and omits articles and plurals, letting context drive meaning.
